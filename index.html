                                    A new wave of oil drilling threatens the Arctic - but today saw the start of the

                                    back.
                                    This morning a lawsuit was filed that could stop the expansion of this reckless
                                    industry

                                    A recent investigation by Greenpeace has found hazardous poly-fluorinated chemicals
                                    (PFCs) in the indoor air of stores selling outdoor gear in Europe and East Asia.
                                    Samples were taken in the flagship stores of the brands Mammut, The North Face,...

                Greenpeace is present in more than 55 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa and the
                Pacific.
            </p>
            <p>To maintain its independence, Greenpeace does not accept donations from governments or corporations but
                relies on
                contributions from individual supporters and foundation grants.
                Greenpeace has been campaigning against environmental degradation since 1971 when a small boat of
                volunteers
                and
                journalists sailed into Amchitka, an area north of Alaska where the US Government was conducting
                underground
                nuclear tests. This tradition of 'bearing witness' in a non-violent manner continues today, and our
                ships
                are an
                important part of all our campaign work.
                We exist to expose environmental criminals, and to challenge government and corporations when they fail
                to
                live
                up to their mandate to safeguard our environment and our future.
                In pursuing our mission, we have no permanent allies or enemies. We promote open, informed debate about
                society's environmental choices. We use research, lobbying, and quiet diplomacy to pursue our goals, as
                well
                as
                high-profile, non-violent conflict to raise the level and quality of public debate.
            </p>
            <p>And we believe that the struggle to preserve the future of our planet is not about us. It's about you.
                Greenpeace
                speaks for 2.8 million supporters worldwide, and encourages many millions more than that to take action
                every
                day.
            </p>
            <p>
                We take the name of our flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, from a North American Cree Indian legend. It
                described a
                time when humanity's greed has made the Earth sick. At that time, a tribe of people known as the
                Warriors of
                the
                Rainbow would rise up to defend her.
                As one of the longest banners we've ever made summed things up, "When the last tree is cut, the last
                river
                poisoned, and the last fish dead, we will discover that we can't eat money..."
